For simple patterns, regular expressions are usually defined within a pair of slashes (/). The square brackets ([ and ]) are used to designate a “character class”. The regular expression will search for any character that matches within this character class.

After the closing slash, the letters g and i are used. A regular expression will stop after the condition is satisfied. Using g for a global search will continue to perform additional searches. Using i for a case-insensitive search allows you to avoid also having to define capitalized vowels.
