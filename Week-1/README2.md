Jamroom where collaborators can get a shared whiteboard(s) for conducting the class

March 28th,2022.Smarto introduces Jamroom which offers online solutions to schools and colleges for LMS, Video Conferencing and Chat rooms to solve the problem of virtual whiteboard space for our customers. Jamroom is an innovative tool that allows teachers to interact with students with a whiteboard-style experience, only digitally without being in the same room. It's essentially a giant digital whiteboard that can be used by any teacher for any subject, making it a great tool for schools.

The Jamroom can be accessed via the App Launcher in Samrto Workspace on the web, and you can also use this app on your iOS or Android smartphone, tablet or Chromebook. Depending on the device you are using to access the app, you will have different features available to you and be able to use the basic functionality of the tool to add sticky notes, text boxes, shapes and images to a jam. You will be able to create additional frames in your Jam file to group relevant discussions together, and will be able to share your Jam file with students for submissions and reviewing,correcting purposes for teachers.

Jamroom makes you able to use the basic functionality of the tool to add sticky notes, text boxes, shapes and images to a jam.It can be leveraged to build communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity. A Jam can be used for a team to brainstorm and develop new ideas. In the classroom you can engage students in problem solving exercises.If you teach the same class more than once, you can duplicate the entire Jamboard for another class. Have each small group organise the words into categories that make sense to them. After they finish, have each group share their thoughts with everyone else.

Give each corner one possible solution, theory, or plan. Have the students choose their breakout room based on their choice of the best solution. Create a Jamboard with a line that has the opposite choices at each end. Have the students put their initials, a picture, or a Bitmoji of themselves on the line showing where they stand on the matter at the beginning of class.Divide students into breakout rooms, and give each room its own board. Preload the boards with the vocabulary words on sticky notes. They will create a new sticky note between the words to show the connection.


“We are excited to help our customers become more creative and use the resources we had,’’ said Brain, VP of Product at Smarto, “with Jamrooms, we are releasing the best and great quality for online education and responsiveness to make a more delightful product experience.”’

“Thanks for the info on Jamroom. My school has G Suite but it seems that the version I have access to doesn’t have a lot of the features in YouTube videos, like inserting a document from Drive. It only allows images.  This looks like an awesome app if we can use all of the tools.Thanks for your help.” said One of my graduates, Jessica McDermitt, used Jamboard to do Vocabulary Vine in her high school English classroom.
