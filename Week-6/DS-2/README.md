# APPROACH

Intuition:

Draw the path that the spiral makes. We know that the path should turn clockwise whenever it would go out of bounds or into a cell that was previously visited.

# --------------------------------- Algorithm-------------------------------

ALGORITHM:

Let the array have R rows and C columns. seen[r] denotes that the cell on the r-th row and c-th column was previously visited. Our current position is (r, c), facing direction di, and we want to visit R x C total cells.

As we move through the matrix, our candidateâ€™s next position is (cr, cc). If the candidate is in the bounds of the matrix and unseen, then it becomes our next position; otherwise, our next position is the one after performing a clockwise turn.

# ---------------------------------------------------VERBAL----------------------

for ans;//arraylist<integer>();
->seen[R][C] boolean
for loop ===> r=0,c=0,di=0
dc={1,0,-1,0}, dr={0,1,0,-1}  => cr= r+dr[di], cc=c+dc[di]
if(cr>=0 && cr<R && cc>=0 && cc<C && !seen[cr][cc]) ==> r=cr; c=cc;
else { di= (di+1)%4; r= r+dr[di]; c= c+dc[di]; }
return ans


Complexity Analysis:

# Time Complexity:
 O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the input matrix. We add every element in the matrix to our final answer.
#  
#  Space Complexity: 
O(N), the information stored in seen and in ans.
